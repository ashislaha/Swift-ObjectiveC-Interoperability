# Swift ObjectiveC Interoperability with App Target and multiple Static Libraries.

Let's discover 
1. how to create a project where both swift and objective c belongs to App Tarbet and interact with each other. 

2. We will discuss more advanced by creating swift and objective c static library and how they can interact with each other.

3. We will discuss about module.modulemap and how it is helping us to modularise the APIs.
